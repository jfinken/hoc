hoc - higher order calculator
=============================

## Overview

`hoc` is a command-line calculator directly inspired by Kernighan and Pike[1].  
The structure of the input accepted by `hoc` is specified by a formal
grammar, and the Look-Ahead Left-Right parser for this grammar 
is automatically generated by `yacc`[2].

The accompanying low-level input lexical analyzer for `hoc` is written in Go, 
thus `goyacc` is used as the parser-generator program to generate a Go parser 
and control the input process.

A feature of `hoc` is that it supports 64-bit floating point values
as opposed to simple 64-bit integer values.  Thus a possible name
for the program _could_ be `fhoc`, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the
reader who forks the project.

## Requirements

 * As of Go 1.8 [`goyacc`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc) 
 (formerly `go tool yacc`)
 * [readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline)

## Generate, compile and run `hoc` 

	$ goyacc -o hoc.go -p Hoc hoc.y
	$ go build 
    $
    $ ./hoc
    hoc> 2.35 * 4.5
    10.5750
    hoc> a = 2*1024*1024
    hoc> a
    2097152.0000
    hoc> a / 2048
    1024.0000
    hoc>
